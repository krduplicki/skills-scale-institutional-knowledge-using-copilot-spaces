# OctoAcme Project Management Processes — Overview

OctoAcme’s project management processes are designed for efficient, transparent, and value-driven delivery across cross-functional teams. Projects begin with rigorous initiation: the business need is validated, stakeholders and champions are identified, and success criteria are established—documented through the Project One-pager and stakeholder alignment meetings. Once approved, work is broken into actionable increments during planning, with prioritized backlog items, clear acceptance criteria, scope estimation, and milestone mapping. Risk management is ongoing, with risks and dependencies tracked in a Risk Register and escalated via well-defined paths.

Key roles and personas ensure accountability and collaboration. The Project Manager (PM) coordinates delivery, schedules, and risk, while the Product Manager (PdM) owns the product vision and prioritization. Developers implement features, maintain code quality, and participate in reviews, while QA/testers validate acceptance criteria and overall quality. Stakeholders—including sponsors, engineering, and support—provide input and approvals at critical milestones. Communication is structured through weekly PM/PdM syncs, daily team standups, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations as needed.

Execution is tracked using project boards with columns for Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done. A disciplined pull request workflow emphasizes small, reviewable changes and automated checks. Quality assurance is integrated: unit and integration tests for new logic, manual QA for feature acceptance, end-to-end smoke tests before release, and security scanning in CI pipelines. Release and deployment processes are standardized with pre-release checklists, staged rollouts, rollback plans, and release notes. Incidents trigger a blameless response and retrospective for ongoing improvement.

Continuous improvement is embedded through regular retrospectives after each sprint or milestone, focusing on learnings and actionable improvements. Action items are documented with clear ownership and deadlines, reviewed in PM syncs, and measured for impact. This systematic approach—anchored in documentation, role clarity, robust workflows, and feedback loops—ensures OctoAcme delivers projects with consistency, adaptability, and a strong emphasis on quality and stakeholder communication.
